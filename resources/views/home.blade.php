                The Department of Computer Engineering was formally created in 1997 with the approval of
                the Statutes of the
                School of Technology and Management (Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestão - ESTG),
                but its origins lie in the area of Computer Science that has existed at ESTG
                since it began operating in the 1989/90 academic year.

                The Department of Computer Engineering is a functional unit of the ESTG to which
                teachers,
                laboratories and support services related to the teaching of
                computer engineering are assigned.
                The Department of Computer Engineering is responsible for a number of undergraduate,
                master's and postgraduate
                courses, as well as the recently created Higher Professional Technical Courses. It is
                also responsible for teaching
                various curricular units in the area of Computer Science that are part of the curriculum
                of other courses taught at
                ESTG. The activities carried out by the the Department of Computer Engineering follow
                the strategic guidelines
                defined by ESTG's bodies (Scientific Council, Pedagogical Council and Management).

                The Master's course in Computer Engineering - Mobile Computing has been recognized by
                ENAEE (European Network for
                Accreditation of Engineering Education) through the award of the EUR-ACE® Quality Mark.
                The distinction places the
                quality of teaching in this course at the Polytechnic of Leiria at the level of the best
                European universities and
                polytechnics, and confirms the international dimension of the School's diplomas,
                encouraging greater acceptance of
                engineers graduating from the Polytechnic of Leiria throughout Europe.
